Content Based Image Retrieval is the application of computer vision techniques to the image retrieval problem: searching for images in large databases given its content. In other words, it must use the contents of the image, rather than metadata, to search the image in the database. It has multiple techniques, but we will focus on Query By Example, which involves providing the CBIR system with an image and it will retrieve the most similar ones, similar to google search by image.

We thought that this technology could be very useful in mainly for entity recognition, identifying what is on the given picture. We have decided to develop a program which will be able to receive an image of a mushroom and retrieve the most similar ones. The functionality is the ability to detect which mushrooms could be poisonous and prevent people from eating them just by taking a simple picture.
